/**
 * PathFinder is an abstract class with a single public method called findCellsToOpen.
 * findCellsToOpen is used to find and open all the cells that should be revealed after the user clicks on an empty cell.
 * The cell located in grid[row][col] must be empty (the cell symbol is '0'). This is pushed onto the stack, added to makeVisible (which is a Stack with references to GridComponent objects) and we search
 * its neighboring cells. Any neighbor empty cells are pushed onto the stack and any cells containing a numerical value are opened and added to makeVisible,
 * but not pushed to the stack. Repeat until the stack is empty.
